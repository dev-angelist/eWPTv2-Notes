# How to write a PT Report

## What is a PT Report?

The scope section in a penetration test report acts like a roadmap, outlining the boundaries of what was assessed. It clarifies what systems, networks, or applications the pentester examined, essentially defining the "battleground" for vulnerability hunting. Additionally, the scope details the "weapons" used - were they simulating an external attacker (black-box) or utilizing some internal knowledge (white-box)? It also highlights any "off-limits" areas or limitations, ensuring everyone understands the boundaries of the testing process. This transparency sets clear expectations for both the client and the pentester, allowing for a well-defined assessment and a more accurate interpretation of the identified vulnerabilities and their potential impact.
