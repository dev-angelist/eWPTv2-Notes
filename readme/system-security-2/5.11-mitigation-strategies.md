## Mitigation Strategies

Mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities is crucial for securing web applications. Here are some effective strategies that can be proposed to clients to address and prevent SQL injection attacks:

### **Prepared Statements**

**Description:**

* **What it is:**
  * Prepared statements separate SQL code from user inputs by using bind variables.
  * This is considered the best solution to mitigate SQL injection.
*   **Implementation Example (PHP):**

    ```php
    $sql = "INSERT INTO test_table VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)";
    $sql_statement = $mysqli->prepare($sql);
    $sql_statement->bind_param('dsss', $user_id, $name, $address, $email);
    $user_id = $_POST['user_id'];
    $name = $_POST['name'];
    $address = $_POST['address'];
    $email =  $_POST['email'];
    $sql_statement->execute();
    ```

**Recommendation:**

* Implementing prepared statements might require code refactoring but provides a robust long-term solution.

### **Type Casting**

**Description:**

* **What it is:**
  * Type casting involves explicitly converting user inputs to a specific data type, particularly useful for integer numbers.
*   **Implementation Example (PHP):**

    ```php
    $user_id = (int) $user_id;
    ```

**Recommendation:**

* Type casting offers a short-term method to prevent SQL injection, especially for numeric values.

### **Input Validation**

**Description:**

* **What it is:**
  * Input validation checks user inputs against a predefined set of rules, allowing only valid inputs.
*   **Implementation Example (PHP):**

    ```php
    if (!preg_match('|^[a-z\s-]$|i', $name)) {
        die('Please enter a valid name');
    }
    ```

**Recommendation:**

* Input validation acts as a good practice to supplement other security measures.
* White-list-based validation, allowing only specific characters, can enhance security.
