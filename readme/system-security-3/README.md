File attacks often involve manipulating or exploiting files to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code. Common methods include file injection, path traversal, and buffer overflow attacks. For instance, in a path traversal attack, an attacker manipulates file paths to access directories and files outside the intended scope, potentially exposing sensitive information.

Resource attacks, on the other hand, target the availability and proper functioning of system resources such as memory, CPU, and network bandwidth. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a prevalent form of resource attack, where attackers overwhelm system resources to render services unavailable to legitimate users. These attacks can disrupt operations, cause financial losses, and damage the reputation of organizations.
