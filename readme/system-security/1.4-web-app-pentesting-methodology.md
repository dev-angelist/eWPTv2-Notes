# 1.4 Web App Pentesting Methodology

## Common Methodology

A **methodology** ensures that penetration tests are performed consistently across different web applications and projects, providing standardized procedures and techniques on all necessary areas.

The more common phases are:

1. **Pre-engagement:**
   * Define the scope of the test: Identify the target web application, its components, and any specific areas or functionalities to be tested.
   * Obtain necessary permissions: Ensure you have explicit authorization from the organization or individual responsible for the web application.
   * Gather information: Collect information about the web application, including its technologies, architecture, and potential entry points.
2. **Reconnaissance:**
   * Passive information gathering: Use search engines, social media, and publicly available information to gather details about the target organization, its employees, and its infrastructure.
   * Active information gathering: Utilize tools like Nmap, Shodan, or automated web scanners to discover open ports, services, and web application components.
3. **Vulnerability Analysis:**
   * Manual inspection: Review the source code, configuration files, and any documentation available to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   * Automated scanning: Use vulnerability scanners like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or Nessus to identify common security flaws such as injection flaws, broken authentication, and session management issues.
   * Fuzzing: Employ fuzzing techniques to input unexpected or malformed data to discover vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or input validation issues.
4. **Exploitation:**
   * Exploit identified vulnerabilities: Use manual or automated techniques to exploit the discovered vulnerabilities, gaining unauthorized access or control over the web application.
   * Attempt privilege escalation: If initial access is limited, attempt to escalate privileges to gain further access to sensitive data or functionality.
   * Maintain persistence: Establish backdoors or maintain access to the web application to ensure continued exploitation even after the testing period ends.
5. **Post-exploitation:**
   * Data extraction: Retrieve sensitive information, such as user credentials, personal data, or proprietary information.
   * Cover tracks: Erase evidence of the penetration test to avoid detection and maintain the confidentiality of the testing process.
   * Documentation: Record all findings, including the vulnerabilities discovered, the exploitation techniques used, and recommendations for remediation.
6. **Reporting:**
   * Compile a comprehensive report detailing the findings of the penetration test, including an executive summary, technical details of vulnerabilities, risk ratings, and recommendations for remediation.
   * Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact on the organization's assets and operations.
   * Present the findings to the stakeholders, including technical teams responsible for maintaining the web application and decision-makers responsible for allocating resources for remediation efforts.
7. **Follow-up:**
   * Collaborate with the organization's teams to address and remediate the identified vulnerabilities.
   * Conduct re-testing to verify the effectiveness of remediation efforts and ensure that previously identified vulnerabilities have been adequately addressed.
   * Provide ongoing support and guidance to improve the organization's security posture and mitigate future risks.

## **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**

[PTES](https://github.com/penetration-testing-execution-standard) stands for the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard**, a comprehensive methodology that encompasses all facets of security assessments, including thorough examination of web applications. It offers a systematic framework starting from pre-engagement activities to post-assessment reporting and follow-up, rendering it ideal for in-depth evaluations.

## OWASP - Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)

The [Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) ](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)Project produces the premier cybersecurity testing resource for web application developers and security professionals.

The **WSTG** is a comprehensive guide to testing the security of web applications and web services. Created by the collaborative efforts of cybersecurity professionals and dedicated volunteers, the WSTG provides a framework of best practices used by penetration testers and organizations all over the world.

### OWASP - TOP 10

The [**OWASP Top 10**](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Using the **OWASP Top 10** is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.
